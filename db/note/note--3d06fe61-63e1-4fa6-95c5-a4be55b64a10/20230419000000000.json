    "content": "On February 16, 2023 Platypus lost $9m due to a logic error    when handling withdrawals with borrowed assets.    In a series of bizarre twists attacker failed to implement    a withdrawal function in their exploit contract effectively    freezing most of the stolen assets, got hacked by the BlockSec     team which recovered $2.4m USDC, and also got doxxed by     none other than ZachXBT.     Overall a happy end to a very sloppy hack.",
