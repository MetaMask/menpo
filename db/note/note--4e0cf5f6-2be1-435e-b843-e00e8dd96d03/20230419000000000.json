Attacker borrows plsGLP (longtail - high risk asset)\n      3. Attacker lends plsGLP and receives iplsGLP\n      4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated\n      5. The key issue is that the oracle price of plsGLP is manipulatable - Oracles\n      6. The higher the value of plsGLP the higher the profit is able to be extracted.\n      7.
