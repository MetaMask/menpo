    "description": "The attacker exploited a vulnerability in Pando Rings        price oracle and manipulated the price of sBTC-WBTC        (liquidity provider token of the trading pair BTC-WBTC on 4swap)        to attempt a theft of approximately $70 million worth of crypto assets.        $21,877,098.03 worth of crypto assets including ETH, EOS and BTC        were transferred out from the attacker's two perpetrating Mixin wallets        before measures could be taken.",
